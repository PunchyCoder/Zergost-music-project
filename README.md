## Where am I?
So, to start, I've already gone ahead with a more-than-basic wireframe. I wouldn't even call it a wireframe, I just got started on it. I often feel like I can't doing a wireframe is a bit of wasted time. Reason being that I often don't quite know how I'm going to pull off the layout in the design doc I've created beforehand. I think it's mostly because of my inexperience in building things(apps, websites).
With that said, I know as I build more things, I'll have more confidence in what I'm capable of. I also think that I should build a wireframe anyways as a way of practice, even if it's a little more work. I think it'll probably make the process quicker in the long-run.

* So I've got a fair Mobile-view whipped up.
* I need to focus on carving out the tablet and Desktop views before I worry/work on any other aesthetic choices(CSS).
